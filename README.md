### Visting websites using HTTP vs HTTPS
**Super short version:** HTTP vs HTTPS, the "S" in HTTPS stands for secure. When you use websites with only HTTP, your internet service provider(ISP) or cellphone network can see what site you visited and all the things you did on that site. When you use websites with HTTPS, your ISP or cellphone network can see what site you visted but not what you do or the content being viewed. Unfortuantly, not every website has HTTPS enabled on their website but it's becoming more common.

## Should I install a VPN on my router or use a VPN software?
This is up to you. The reason most people say it's better to have a VPN installed on your router is so you don't forget to tunnel into your VPN software. My argument against that is you have to use a VPN software outside your home to stay protected.  So might as well have one solution, make it a habit, and don't have to buy a second router and install a VPN on it.

## Protecting yourself everywhere you go

## Protect your home networks
If you still want to buy 2 routers and install a VPN on your home network, then here is a [tutorial]( http://troypoint.com/install-vpn-router/). 

## Protection against site tracking
- Stop using Internet Explorer PLEASE!
- I started using the browser [Brave](https://brave.com/) because it already blocks ads and enables the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere). You'll have faster web page speed loads, especially on mobile devices because of all the ad tracking it blocks. Also, it's built off of Chrome so it acts/performs roughly the same.
- OR if you're not ready to give up your favorite browser(excluding IE), this can be solved 
- All browser plugins are usually for Chrome, Firefox, or Opera.
- To block spying ads and invisible trackers - Download [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
- Encrypt your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure - Download [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
- Goolge and Bing track your searching. If that bothers you, use [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/)
